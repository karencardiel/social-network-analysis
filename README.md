# Social Network Analysis – UPY Experience

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **analyzing social networks** using data visualization and graph theory techniques. Our goal is to understand how individuals are connected within a network, identify central and peripheral actors, and discover patterns of influence and interaction.

The data was manually collected through a Google Form and Instagram research, and then processed to build a network graph for analysis.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Visualize the connections between users in a network.
- Identify central and peripheral nodes using metrics like degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality.
- Analyze the structure of the network and the influence of certain individuals.

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** Survey and Instagram-based data gathering.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Formatting the data for network analysis.
3. **Network Analysis:** Applying centrality metrics and visualizing the network using tools like NetworkX and matplotlib.
4. **Interpretation:** Drawing insights and conclusions from the network structure.

## 🧪 Example Output

Below is an example of the network graph generated from our analysis:

This visualization shows the social network colored according to **closeness centrality**.  
- Nodes with darker or warmer colors (toward red) have higher centrality, indicating greater influence or accessibility within the network.
- The colorbar on the right reflects the closeness centrality score.
- The list shows the ranked scores for each individual in the network.

This helps identify key individuals who are most efficiently connected to others in the network.
